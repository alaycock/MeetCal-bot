Hey!

It looks like you were trying to make a post so it shows up on the calendar. Unfortunately you messed up the title a little bit. Give it another shot using the format [EVENT][LOCATION][DATE][TIME]. Don't put the end-time or date in your title, because it can cause problems. If you want to try again, feel free to delete the post and try again.
